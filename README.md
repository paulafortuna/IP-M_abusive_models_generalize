# IP-M_abusive_models_generalize

This repository aims at centralizing the code used to support the paper:



In this work we test the generalization of models trained with abusive and harms related datasets.
As this was a very complex experiment with different phases this repository aims at organizing a set of repositories needed for all these experiments.
(Next time I will try to do a more organized software engineer tidy approach).

For these experiments there are some needed datasets. These are not provided on my repository but only listed here instead:
